## Overview

Programming Languages are the duct tape, bricks, mortar
and steel of the information age. Over the last thirty
years, a variety of languages with diverse features have
been developed, expressing radically different perspectives
of the idea of computation. CSE 130 is an introduction to
some of these perspectives, as well as the fundamental concepts of
languages. We shall focus in particular on one paradigm -- functional
programming as embodied in the lambda calculus and the Haskell language. 
Many students will be encountering this
paradigm and these languages for the first time. As with
spoken languages, these are best absorbed by immersing yourself
in the different environments and practicing your skills by
experimentation.

## Integrity of Scholarship

University rules on integrity of scholarship will be strictly enforced. By
taking this course, you implicitly agree to abide by the UCSD Policy on
Integrity of Scholarship described [here](https://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/appendices/2).
In particular,

> all academic work will be done by the student to whom it is assigned,
> without unauthorized aid of any kind.

Incidents which violate the University's rules on integrity of scholarship
will be taken seriously.  In addition to **receiving a zero (0)** on the
assignment/exam in question, students may also face other penalties,
up to and including, expulsion from the University.  Should you have
any doubts about the moral and/or ethical implications of an activity
regarding the course, please see the instructor.
