- Postdoc at MIT

### My Research

- Program Verification: how to *prove* the program is doing the right thing?
- Program Synthesis: how to *generate* a program that does the right thing?

## Lecture Format

Live lecture over Zoom during scheduled lecture time

- Keep your *mic* off unless you are talking
- Keep your *video* on if you can: it makes it much more fun for me!
- Two ways to ask a question:
    1. "Raise your hand" in zoom and I will call on you
    2. Type into zoom chat
- Please do not use public Zoom chat for random commentary, it's distracting   
- Same if I ask you a question
- I will split you into breakout rooms for small-group discussion
    - Same group throughout the quarter (hopefully)
    - You'll be sent to the room and back automatically    
    - Let's test that!
    
    
Lectures will also be recorded and published on canvas

## What is CSE 130 **not** about?

Learning... 

- JavaScript in April
- Haskell in May
- C++ in June
- etc. 

### New languages come (and go ...)

There was no

- Python      30 years ago
- Java        25 years ago
- C#          20 years ago
- Rust        10 years ago
- WebAssembly 5 years ago


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## What is CSE 130 about?

- Concepts in programming languages
- Language design and implementation


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>



## A Programming Language

### Two Variables

- `x`, `y`

### Three Operations

- `x++`
- `x--`
- `x = 0 ? L1 : L2`


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## Example Program

(What _does_ it do?)

```
L1: x++
    y--
    y = 0 ? L2 : L1
L2: ...
```


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## The above language is "equivalent to" every PL!

But good luck writing 

- QuickSort
- Fortnite
- Spotify

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## So Why Study Programming Languages?

![Federico Fellini](/static/img/fellini.png){#fig:fellini .align-center width=25%}

> A different language
> is
> a different vision
> of life.


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## So Why Study Programming Languages?

> The principle of **linguistic relativity**
> holds that the structure of a language
> affects its speakers world view or cognition.

Or more simply:

> Programming Language
> shapes
> Programming Thought.

Language affects how ideas and computation are expressed

## Course Goals

![130 Brain](https://ucsd-cse130.github.io/wi20/static/img/galaxy-brain-130.jpg){#fig:morpheus .align-center width=40%}

> Free Your Mind.



<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Goal: Learn the Anatomy of PL

![Anatomy](/static/img/anatomy.png){#fig:anatomy .align-center width=20%}


- What makes a programming language?
- Which features are **fundamental** and which are **syntactic sugar**? 





<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## Goal: Learn New Languages / Constructs

![Musical Score](/static/img/music-score.png){#fig:music .align-center width=30%}

New ways to **describe** and **organize** computation,
to create programs that are:

- **Correct**
- **Readable**
- **Extendable**
- **Reusable**



<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>






## Goal: How to Design new Languages

New hot lanuages being designed in industry as we speak:

- Flow, React @ Facebook     
- Rust @ Mozilla, 
- TypeScript @ Microsoft
- Swift @ Apple
- WebAsssembly @ Google + Mozilla + Microsoft

Buried in every large system is a (domain-specific) language

- DB: SQL
- Word, Excel: Formulas, Macros, VBScript
- Emacs: LISP
- Latex, shell scripts, makefiles, ...

If you work on a large system, you **will** design a new PL!



<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Goal: Enable You To Choose Right PL

But isn't that decided by

- Libraries
- Standards
- Hiring
- Your Boss?!

Yes.

**My goal:** Educate tomorrow's leaders so you'll make **informed** choices.

## **QuickSort** in C

```c
void sort(int arr[], int beg, int end){
  if (end > beg + 1){
    int piv = arr[beg];
    int l = beg + 1;
    int r = end;
    while (l != r-1)
       if(arr[l] <= piv) l++;
       else swap(&arr[l], &arr[r--]);
    if(arr[l]<=piv && arr[r]<=piv)
       l=r+1;
    else if(arr[l]<=piv && arr[r]>piv)
       {l++; r--;}
    else if (arr[l]>piv && arr[r]<=piv)
       swap(&arr[l++], &arr[r--]);
    else r=l-1;
    swap(&arr[r--], &arr[beg]);
    sort(arr, beg, r);
    sort(arr, l, end);
  }
}
```



<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## **QuickSort** in Haskell

```Haskell
sort []     = []
sort (x:xs) = sort ls ++ [x] ++ sort rs
  where
    ls      = [ l | l <- xs, l <= x ]
    rs      = [ r | r <- xs, x <  r ]
```

(not a wholly [fair comparison...](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7717691/why-is-the-minimalist-example-haskell-quicksort-not-a-true-quicksort))

## In-class Quizzes

We will do quizzes in class via Zoom polls

  - Make class interactive
  - Help *you* and *me* understand what's tricky
    
**Protocol**

1. *Solo Vote*
    - I show the quiz on my screen and start a poll
    - Think for yourself, select answer

2. *Discuss*
    - Go into your *breakout room*
    - To see the quiz, open the lecture notes from the class website
    - Analyze problem with your groups
    - Reach consensus
    - I will "call you back" from the room when time's up

3. *Group Vote*
    - Everyone in group votes
    - Hopefully the same way but not enforced

4. *Class Discuss*
    - What was easy or tricky?
