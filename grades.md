- There will be *six* programming assignments, assigned every one or two weeks.

- You will submit assignments via Gradescope.
- You can work on the assignment *either alone or in groups of two*.
- If you are working with a partner and submitting the same code, please *submit as a group* (otherwise identical code might be flagged as plagiarism).


**Late Policy**

You have a total of *eight late days* that you can use throughout the quarter,
but no more than *four late days* per assignment.
    
- A late day means anything between 1 second and 23
  hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds past a deadline    
- If you submit past the late day limit, you get 0 points for that assignment
- There is no penalty for submitting late but within the limit
      
### Midterm (25%)

- Will be held on **Monday, May 2**.
- Format: multiple choice quiz on Gradescope, available for 24 hours.  

### Final (30%)
  
- Will be held on **Friday, June 10**.
- Format: programming assignment. Solved individually in the course of 24 hours, but otherwise similar to homeworks.
  
Since the final is cumulative, your midterm grade will be calculated as 
`midterm > 0 ?  max(final, midterm) : 0`.
This means that you get a second chance if you don’t do well on the midterm but 
you must turn in both the midterm and the final.
